This is a Baseball game coded in Veriog and implemented on a FPGA board.

The "animation.v" file is where the top module is and the "controlpath.v" and "datapath.v" files makes up the finite state machines used in the game.
The rest of the .v files are ROM memory blocks for the images used in the game, excpet for the vga files which contain the modules for vga display.
The .mif files are the image files.
